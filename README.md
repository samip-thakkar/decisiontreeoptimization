# decisiontreeoptimization
The program uses decision tree classification to predict whether the user purchased or not based on salary and age. Optimization was done and accuracy was increased by 7%. A decision tree visualization is also given by the program.
To visualize Decision Tree, we need to import pydotplus and for that set graphviz environment by downloading graphviz.msi and set path to path environment variable.
Try conda install python-graphviz and if it doesn't work try downloading msi file from https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html and set path from environment variable to path which you give when you run msi file.
